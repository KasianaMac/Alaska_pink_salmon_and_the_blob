Found a dataset about sea ice volume at the [UW's Polar Science Center](http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/).  It looks a lot like extent data...

There are a gazillion images of sea ice extent and anomalies - I think that's probably the better way to go for this one.
